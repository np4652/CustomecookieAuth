# Custom Cookie-based Authorization in .NET Core

This project demonstrates a custom approach to cookie-based authorization in .NET Core, offering an alternative to the built-in Identity system. By leveraging .NET Core's middleware architecture, this solution provides a lightweight and flexible way to manage user authentication and authorization using cookies.

Key Features:

Custom Authentication Middleware: Implement a custom middleware for authenticating users based on cookie tokens.
Authorization Policy: Define custom authorization policies to control access to resources within the application.
User Management: Manage user sessions, authentication, and authorization without relying on the ASP.NET Core Identity framework.
Secure Cookie Handling: Ensure secure cookie handling practices to prevent common security vulnerabilities such as session fixation and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
Sample Application: Includes a sample application demonstrating how to integrate custom cookie-based authorization into a .NET Core web application.
Usage:

Clone the repository.
Build and run the sample application to see custom cookie-based authorization in action.
Customize and extend the provided middleware and authorization policies to suit your application's specific requirements.
