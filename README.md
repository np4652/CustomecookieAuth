# Custom Cookie-based Authorization in .NET Core

This project demonstrates a custom approach to cookie-based authorization in .NET Core, offering an alternative to the built-in Identity system. By leveraging .NET Core's middleware architecture, this solution provides a lightweight and flexible way to manage user authentication and authorization using cookies.

# Key Features:
    1. Authorization Policy : Define custom authorization policies to control access to resources within the application.

    2. User Management : Manage user sessions, authentication, and authorization without relying on the ASP.NET Core Identity framework.
    
    3. Sample Application : Includes a sample application demonstrating how to integrate custom cookie-based authorization into a .NET Core web application.

# Usage:

Clone the repository.
Build and run the sample application to see custom cookie-based authorization in action.
Customize and extend the provided middleware and authorization policies to suit your application's specific requirements.
